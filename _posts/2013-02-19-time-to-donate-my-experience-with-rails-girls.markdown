During a lunch discussion over some dumplings, [Shufen](https://twitter.com/ffchao)
mentioned that she was going to start a [Rails Girls in Dallas](http://railsgirls.com/dallas).
Several of us immediately volunteered. I have an affinity for teaching so this
struck me as a great opportunity to do something I love. Additionally, an
event like this might help a teenager pick a future. It could motivate a mother to
reenter the work force after years of staying home with her children. It might
help a small business launch or provide an existing one with a much needed boost.
The decision to help was quick and easy.

### What is Rails Girls?
Rails Girls was a concept born in Helsinki, Finland and carried out for the first
time back in November of 2010. The goal was, and still is, to provide women with an
inspiring introduction to programming. There are no age or skill requirements and
admission is free. The two day event starts on Friday night with a software install
party. Saturday gives a taste of programming via Ruby and provides a peek into
the power of Rails. Events are organized independently by local people with
[guides](http://guides.railsgirls.com) that help every step of the way. Oh, and
because it's a Rails event, there's always a [FridayHug](http://fridayhug.com).

### Good Things Come to Those Who Give
It turns out that I did meet curious teens, mothers going back to work, and
aspiring entrepreneurs. Most of my time was spent working with a great mother
and daughter pair. The teen's stepfather was a programmer and this gave them the
opportunity to learn more about what he does and to explore it for themselves. 
I got the chance to practice teaching and share my passion for programming. I
knew some of the coaches before hand but I met others that shared my enthusiasm
and who I've talked with since (one even came out to a hack night that my employer
hosts).

Rails Girls doesn't pay coaches or speakers but our event covered breakfast,
lunch and a free t-shirt. One sponser paid for our coaches dinner on Friday
night. Ryan Bates was kind enough to provide everyone involved in the
event with a credit for three months of [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/).
Finally, coaches and participants were given a large credit toward registration
for the first ever [Big Ruby Conf](http://www.bigrubyconf.com/). People are all
too happy to support important projects and the individuals helping to make them
happen.

### Get Out and Give
For me, Rails Girls combined two things I feel strongly about. First, I enjoy
working in Ruby and using Rails. Second, I believe a community is strongest when
it is diverse. We practice diversity at a technical level. It might be having a
[keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) by Clojure's own Rich Hickey
at RailsConf 2012 or spending the time to delve into Node.js. However, there's
another type of diversity that we need to address.

We need to look at the individuals that make up the community. The
way a person views and interacts with the world is largely derived from past
experience. When the members of a group share a significant overlap in experience
they are less likely to challenge one another. A quick internet search will show
a bevy of research lauding the advantages of diversity. Studies cite improvements
in creativity and innovation resulting from the varied perspectives of the
participants.

Rails Girls is focused on helping women, but that's not our only underrepresented
group. Consider impoverished individuals who grow up without computers readily
available for tinkering. I toured a [KIPP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Is_Power_Program)
school where posters advertised the job opportunities that are available with a
good education and the salaries they provide. "Software Developer" was listed on the
wall of the math room. Most of those kids have probably never met a software
developer. With limited resources and no mentors how many can we expect to see
take an interest in development? Consider how many cultural and social groups are
underrepresented or non-existent among the ranks of developers.

The industry isn't perfect but every time I've been involved in hiring new people
we've looked for friendly, hard working, bright people. There are people out there
that fit that discription and would be fantastic additions to the community but
never got the opportunity. Providing materials, knowledge and mentorship to those who
least have it can create immense opportunity.

It doesn't have to be Rails Girls. It doesn't have to be related to Ruby. You can
work with kids or adults, stay in your neighborhood or mentor in another. What's
important is that you find something you're comfortable with and go.
