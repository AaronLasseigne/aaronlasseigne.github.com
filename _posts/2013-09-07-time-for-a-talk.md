One thing I like to do is teach and share.
I help organize our lunch and learns at work.
I've presented a few times but I haven't done any outside of work.
As a regular attendee of the [Dallas Ruby Brigade][1] (DRB) I figured it was time for me to present to the group.
I decided to extend a previous presentation I had given called "It's About Time".

<div class="embed-container">
  <script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="65ff6b10f7a60130b70c5ebc3e751cce" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
</div>

DRB usually gets somewhere between 30-40 people at the primary meeting which means I had a good size audience for my talk.
Someday I'd like to present at a conference.
In the meantime I'm already thinking of other presentations for the DRB.
