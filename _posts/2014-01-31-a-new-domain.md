Welcome to my new domain.
I recently moved this blog from http://ficate.com to where you find it now.
The old domain was shorter and easier to spell but it never felt right.
The pronunciation wasn't obvious and it didn't really provide any benefit.

In addition to a new domain I've switched from [Octopress][1] to [Jekyll][2].
<!--more-->
Octopress was too heavy for my fairly minimal needs.
As a result, it got in the way more than it helped.
Jekyll has been a fantastic replacement.
It's slim and easy to work with.

Lastly, I've cleaned up the look of the site.
The layout is the same but I've made a lot of small tweaks.
I'm happy with my new look for the new year.
