title: "A New Atom Feed"

I recently changed my subscription feed to use the .atom extension.
After reading [Serving Atom feeds with GitHub Pages][1] I've decided to make this change.
The old feed will continue to work for a short while but please update your links.
If you use [Feedly][2] please remove and re-add my feed.
You can add it again easily by going to [this subscription page][3] and clicking the green "+feedly" button.
