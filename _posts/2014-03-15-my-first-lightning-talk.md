title: "My First Lightning Talk"

This year marked the second ever [Big Ruby][1] conference and my first ever lightning talk at a conference.
I've [previously written][2] about giving talks at work and at the local Ruby group.
Presenting to an entire conference (it's single track) is certainly more daunting.
It was a lot of fun though.
You can watch my talk below (starting at 3:22) or thumb through the slides.
