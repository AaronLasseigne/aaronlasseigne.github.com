By day I'm a Ruby developer working at [OrgSync][1] and an author for [SitePoint][7].
By night I'm... likely still coding.
I'm fortunate in that I get to do what I love for a living.
Most of my career has been in Ruby but I've also worked in Perl and PHP.
Lately I find myself drawn increasingly toward Clojure and Elixir.

Outside of coding I look for ways to share what I know.
I've coached for [Rails Girls][2] and [presented][3] for my [local Ruby group][4].
I run a Lunch and Learn program at OrgSync where we take turns either presenting or watching and discussing interesting talks.
I actively write here and for the [OrgSync Dev Blog][5].

Tweaking my programming environment is also a favorite past time.
If you're interested in my setup, my [dotfiles][6] are available for perusing.

When not typing vigorously I read books, watch movies, TV series, and football (mostly college).
I enjoy a good gimlet made with Bombay Sapphire or Hendricks gin.
I'm also one of two people responsible for the life of a small person.

Finally, I run [libgrader][8], a site for finding quality Ruby gems.
