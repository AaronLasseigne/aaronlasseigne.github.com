By day I'm a Ruby developer working at [OrgSync][1].
By night I'm... a developer working at home.
I'm fortunate in that I get to do what I love for a living.
Most of my career has been in Ruby but I've also worked in Perl and PHP.
Lately I find myself drawn increasingly toward Clojure and Elixir.

Outside of coding I look for ways to share what I know.
I've coached for [Rails Girls][2] and [presented][3] for my [local Ruby group][4].
I run a Lunch and Learn program at OrgSync where we take turns either presenting or watching and discussing interesting talks.
I actively write for the [OrgSync Dev Blog][5] and here on my blog.

Tweaking my programming environment is also a favorite past time.
Anything to help me avoid repeating common tasks.
If you're interested in what I've done my [dotfiles][6] are available for perusing.

When not typing vigorously I read books, watch movies, TV series, and football (mostly college).
I enjoy a good gimlet made with Bombay Saphire or Hendricks gin.
I'm also one of two people responsible for the life of a small person.
It's a crazy world.
