I'm a freelance software developer and author.

As a developer I've spent over a decade maintaining legacy code, building new products, leading projects, and managing teams.
Most of my career has been spent creating with Ruby on Rails.
I've also built JavaScript front-ends, most recently with React.js.

As an author you can find my posts here and on [SitePoint].
While most focus on Ruby, I've also covered other languages that interest me, my programming setup, and talks I've given.

In my spare time I've coached for [Rails Girls], spoken to [high school students about programming], and helped to organize my [local Ruby group] where I regularly [present].
I created and maintain [ActiveInteraction] with [Taylor Fausak].
Nothing has changed the way I work with Rails more than service objects.
Existing gems didn't integrate as cleanly into Rails as I wanted.
During a hackathon, Taylor and I built ActiveInteraction and in the time since it's gained a following racking up 740+ stars on GitHub.

I also founded [libgrader.com], a site for checking Ruby gem quality and finding alternative gems.
Designed, built, deployed, and maintained by my own two hands, it has been a labor of love.
It currently has information on over 100k gems which it follows and updates.

If you'd like have me speak, are interested in my writing, or have a need for an expert developer, please feel free to reach out.
