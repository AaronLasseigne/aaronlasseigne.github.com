By day I'm a freelance web developer and an author for [SitePoint][].
By night I'm... likely still coding.
I'm fortunate in that I get to do what I love for a living.
Most of my career has been in Ruby but I've also worked in Perl and PHP.
Lately I find myself drawn increasingly toward Clojure and Elixir.

Outside of coding I look for ways to share what I know.
I've coached for [Rails Girls][] and [presented][] for my [local Ruby group][].
I've started Lunch and Learn programs where developers take turns either presenting or watching and discussing interesting talks.

Tweaking my programming environment is also a favorite past time.
If you're interested in my setup, my [dotfiles][] are available for perusing.

When not typing vigorously I read books, watch movies, TV series, and college football.
I enjoy a good gimlet made with Bombay Sapphire or Hendricks gin.
I'm also one of two people responsible for the life of a small person.

Finally, I run [libgrader][], a site for finding quality Ruby gems.
