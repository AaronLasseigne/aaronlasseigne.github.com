        I've been using Ruby for over ten years, and I'm still surprised to find new corners to explore.
        It wasn't until I came across this book that I realized how deep the string "rabbit hole" went.

    <h2>Why Strings?</h2>

    <p class="subtext">They're <strong>everywhere</strong>!</p>

    <p class="desc">
      As devs, you and I create <strong>tons of strings</strong>.
      Probably <strong>more than any other object</strong> on a day to day basis.
      How much do you really know about strings?
      How about encodings?
      How familiar are you with <strong>Unicode and UTF-8</strong>?
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      Do you know why this would happen?

      <pre><code>'√©' == '√©' <span class="result"># => false</span></code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      Or why this length might be wrong?

      <pre><code>'√†'.length <span class="result"># => 2</span></code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      Do you know what dummy encodings are?

      <pre><code>Encoding::UTF_16.dummy? <span class="result"># => true</span></code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      How about what this does?

      <pre><code>[128077, 32, 128078].pack('U*')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p class="example">
      Do you know how to use an encoding converter?

      <pre><code>Encoding::Converter.new('UTF-8', 'US-ASCII')</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Learn Everything</h2>

    <p class="subtext">Walk away an <strong>expert</strong>!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        By <strong>manipulating individual bytes</strong> you'll gain a better understanding of how encodings work.
        You'll also be better equipped to debug strings.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may have used <strong>Unicode and UTF-8</strong> but do you know the difference?
        Understand what they are and how the most popular encoding in the world works.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not only learn about UTF-8 but know enough to work with any encoding you run across.
        Understand what <strong>code points</strong> are and how to use them.
      </li>
      <li>
        What are <strong>normalization forms</strong>?
        How do you work with them?
        And why are they important?
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn about the <strong>different methods for creating strings</strong>.
        Find out why you should use one over another.
        You'll see helpful methods like <code>%q</code> and <code>*</code>.
        Get the entire story about <strong>how best to use heredocs</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should your object provide an <strong>implicit string conversion</strong> or only explicit?
        Learn the difference between <code>to_s</code> and <code>to_str</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Become an expert in <strong>immutable strings via freezing</strong> them.
        Find out why immutable strings are useful and why it might become the new normal in Ruby 3.0.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go <strong>beyond common methods</strong> so that you know the best method to use at any given moment.
        You'll see how <code>gsub</code> is overused and how methods like <code>delete</code> and <code>tr</code> can be better.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Explore advanced solutions</strong> like using <code>Encoding::Converter</code> to fix invalid characters within a string.

    <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

    <p class="question">What if I‚Äôm unhappy with the book?</p>
    <p>
      There is a 30 day 100% money-back guarantee.
      Buy the book, give it a try, and if you really aren't happy with it, I'll refund your money.
    </p>

    <p class="question">What if I don't learn anything?</p>
    <p>
      Impossible!
      There's so much good information packed into these chapters that I'll bet you learn a lot.
      If you really don't feel like you got anything out of it, you've always got the 30 days to get a refund.
    </p>

    <p class="question">Does the book cover internationalization?</p>
    <p>
      No.
      I've done internationalization work and that's its own whole book.
      However, you can't internationalize your code without understanding encodings.
      This book will provide you or your team with a rock solid foundation that will let you take on the next step of internationalization with confidence.

    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>{{ site.data.author.name }}</strong>.
      I've been using Ruby for more than a decade.
      During that time, I've presented and written about Ruby including 13 articles in Ruby Weekly.
      I organize the Dallas Ruby Brigade and participate in open source.
      My most successful contribution is the ActiveInteraction gem with over 1.5k stars on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      While doing all of this I've gained a strong understanding of Ruby and I'm excited to share what I've learned.
