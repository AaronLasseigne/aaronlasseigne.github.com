    <h2>Developer</h2>
    <p>
      For more than a decade I've lead projects, maintained legacy code, and managed teams.
      Most of my professional work has focused around building Ruby on Rails applications.
      I've also worked on dynamic JavaScript front-ends using jQuery, Backbone, and most recently with React.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my professional career I've explored a variety of languages with two of my favorites being Clojure and Elixir.
      I enjoy working on open source and tinkering on personal projects.

          <p>
            I created <a href="https://github.com/orgsync/active_interaction/">ActiveInteraction</a> with <a href="http://taylor.fausak.me">Taylor Fausak</a> to provide Rails with service objects that fit seemlessly into the existing ecosystem.
            With 760+ stars on GitHub it's been a great success.

            Built using Middleman and a healthy dose of React, <a href="https://tablesofstuff.com">Tables of Stuff</a> provides easy to search tables for a variety of character encodings.
            Check out the <a href="https://tablesofstuff.com/encodings/ascii/">ASCII</a> table for an example.

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>
      I've been a regular attendee of the <a href="http://www.dallasrb.org">Dallas Ruby Brigade</a> for several years.
      I've presented a variety of talks to the group and most recently have taken over as a co-organizer.
      I've also volunteered for Rails Girls, presented to high school students on software development as a career, and sat on the computer science advisory committee for Brookhaven College.

    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>
      Blogging has helped me grow as a developer and provided another avenue for me to help others learn.
      I started blogging in 2012.
      In that time I've been in featured in <strong>Ruby Weekly 10 times</strong> including the top spot for an article covering new methods in Ruby 2.2 which was re-tweeted by Matz (the creator of Ruby).
      I've had articles appear on the Ruby5 podcast, Ruby Inside, and a variety of other sites.
      On occasion you'll find my writings on Sitepoint.
