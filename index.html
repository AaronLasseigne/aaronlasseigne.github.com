    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      During the course of my career I've done a lot.
      The bulk of my professional experience has focused on Ruby (Rails) and JavaScript (React).
      However, I'm an avid learner and have experimented with many other languages on my own time.
      I've played every role on the team from developer, to project lead, to manager.
      I've maintained and updated legacy code and I've taken greenfield projects from start to finish.
    </p>

      You can find out more about my background on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.data.author.linkedin }}/">LinkedIn</a> profile.
      You'll also find some of my open source work in the Contributor section below.

    <h2>Contributor</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy helping the programming community when I can.
      I've been a regular attendee of the <a href="http://www.dallasrb.org">Dallas Ruby Brigade</a> for many years and I now help run the group.
      During that time, I've presented many times on a variety of topics and helped others to ready their first talks.
      I've also volunteered for Rails Girls, presented to high school students on software development as a career, and sat on the computer science advisory committee for Brookhaven College.

          <p>
            I created <a href="https://github.com/AaronLasseigne/active_interaction/">ActiveInteraction</a> with <a href="http://taylor.fausak.me">Taylor Fausak</a> to provide Rails with service objects that fit seamlessly into the existing ecosystem.

    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to by book I've also been blogging since 2012.
      It has helped me grow as a developer and provided another avenue for me to help others learn.
      I've been in <strong>featured in Ruby Weekly</strong> numerous times including the top spot for an article covering new methods in Ruby 2.2 which was re-tweeted by Matz (the creator of Ruby).
      I've had articles appear on the Ruby5 podcast, Ruby Inside, and a variety of other sites.
      On occasion you'll find my writings on Sitepoint.
