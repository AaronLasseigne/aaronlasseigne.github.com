### Exercism.io Answers <small>Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, and Scala</small>

For the unfamiliar, [Exercism.io][2] is a site where you complete coding problems and then get feedback on your solution.
You can also comment on what others have done.
There are lots of languages to choose from so it's a great place to play with a language you might not use everyday.
It's also fun to compare answers to the same problems in different languages.
