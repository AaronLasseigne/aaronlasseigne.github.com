### libgrader

Libgrader is a site I designed, built, and launched that helps developers evaluate Ruby gems for use in their own projects.
It provides gem grades and allows users to add alternative gems.

### ActiveInteraction <small>Ruby</small>

Born from a company hackathon and a Rails code base with too much logic in the controllers and models, this gem give you a way to manage the chaos.
It provides easy to use interactions which help encapsulate business logic.

### Exercism.io Answers <small>Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, and Scala</small>

For the unfamiliar, [Exercism.io][] is a site where you complete coding problems and then get feedback on your solution.
You can also comment on what others have done.
There are lots of languages to choose from so it's a great place to play with a language you might not use everyday.
It's also fun to compare answers to the same problems in different languages.
